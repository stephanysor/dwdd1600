      <h1>The Rulebook</h1>
      <h2>What is the Rulebook</h2>
      <p>
        The so-called “Survivor Rulebook” for killers <strong>isn’t</strong> an
        official set of rules from Behaviour Interactive. Instead, it’s a term
        used by the Dead by Daylight community to describe a list of
        <em>unwritten expectations</em> or “house rules” that some Survivors
        believe Killers should follow. Over time it has led to debate and even
        division within the DBD community about which rules, if any, should be
        followed.
      </p>

      <p>
        This “rulebook” has also been a source of toxicity from both sides:
        Survivors accusing Killers of being unfair, and Killers pushing back
        against being told how to play. At the end of the day, Dead by Daylight
        is meant to be a tense but enjoyable experience for everyone. Nothing
        beats good sportsmanship, and while the game can be tough, the goal
        should always be to have fun.
      </p>

      <p>
        Below are a few personal guidelines I like to follow as Killer to keep
        matches fun and fair for both sides:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Don’t camp hooks unless absolutely necessary.</li>
        <li>
          Avoid tunneling the same Survivor right off hook if there are other
          targets nearby.
        </li>
        <li>Mix up chase targets to give everyone a chance to play.</li>
        <li>Give the last Survivor a chance at the hatch once in a while.</li>
        <li>
          Respect great plays — if a Survivor pulls off something amazing, let
          them have their moment!
        </li>
      </ol>
