      <h2>Patchnotes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Slugging & Recovery Changes:</strong> Survivors can now crawl
          and recover at the same time. Recovery is automatic and crawl speed
          increases over time. Tap Interact when full to pick yourself up.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tunneling Penalties:</strong> If a Survivor dies before
          reaching 6 total hooks, the remaining Survivors gain a 25% generator
          repair speed bonus. Killers lose the ability to block, damage, or
          regress generators after a Survivor is sacrificed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Map Updates:</strong> Pallet distribution and dead-zones
          adjusted across multiple Realms to improve loop balance and reduce
          “no-escape” areas.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Shape (Michael Myers) Rework:</strong> Now features three
          modes — Stalker, Pursuer, and Evil Incarnate. Evil Incarnate unlocks
          new special attacks (like “Slaughtering Strike”) and improved
          vault/break speeds.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Spotlight</h2>
      <h3>Survivor of the Week – Meg Thomas</h3>
      <p>
        Meg Thomas is a high-energy athlete whose perks focus on speed, stealth,
        and clutch escapes. She’s perfect for players who like to rush
        objectives and outmaneuver killers.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Quick & Quiet:</strong> Vault over obstacles and enter lockers
          quickly and silently, suppressing loud noise notifications every 30
          seconds (reduced cooldown at higher perk tiers).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sprint Burst:</strong> Gain a burst of speed (150%) for 3
          seconds when you start running. Causes the Exhausted status effect for
          60/50/40 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Adrenaline:</strong> Instantly heal one health state and
          sprint at 150% speed for 5 seconds when the Exit Gates are powered.
          Works even if you’re hooked or downed (but will put you into the
          Exhausted state after use).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Spotlight: Killer of the Week – The Huntress</h3>
      <p>
        Armed with a deadly set of throwing hatchets, The Huntress excels at
        mid-range pressure and zoning Survivors. Mastering her lullaby and
        hatchet arcs makes her one of the scariest killers in the Fog.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Beast of Prey:</strong> Gain the Undetectable status effect
          when Bloodlust activates and earn bonus Bloodpoints for chasing
          Survivors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Territorial Imperative:</strong> Reveal the aura of Survivors
          who enter the basement while you are at least 32 meters away.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hex: Huntress Lullaby:</strong> Survivors receive a 2%
          regression penalty on missed skill checks, and as the Hex grows
          stronger, skill check warning sounds become shorter until they are
          completely removed.
        </li>
      </ul>
